# Cat RPG

An RPG game inspired by our life in the country with cats. ðŸ˜»
The game mechanics have been inspired by Undertale and the project is to be realised in PyGame. 

Let me note this is my n+1th effort of realising a project in PyGame without ever completing a single tutorial for PyGame but well, that's what makes it fun I guess.
Also my son - Balint, 8 - is really, really eager to make a game so here we go.
